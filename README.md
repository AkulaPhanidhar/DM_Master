## Architecture

The game is structured into modular components to enhance maintainability and scalability. Here's an overview of the architecture:

### Modular Design

- **Main Module (`main.py`)**: Contains the core game loop, handles user input, and orchestrates interactions between other modules.
- **State Manager (`state_manager.py`)**: Responsible for saving and loading the game state, ensuring persistence across sessions.
- **AI Interactions (`ai_interactions.py`)**: Manages all communications with AI services for generating content like descriptions, dialogues, and images.

### AI Integration

- **OpenAI API**: Used for generating dynamic text content, including location descriptions and NPC dialogues.
- **DeepAI API**: Utilized for generating AI-based images that correspond to in-game locations.

### Data Management

- **Game State**: Stored as a JSON file (`game_state.json`), encapsulating all player data, locations, quests, and inventory.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information like API keys are stored in a `.env` file, not included in version control for security.

### Error Handling and Validation

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that user inputs are valid and provides helpful feedback for invalid commands.
- **Error Handling**: Robust try-except blocks prevent crashes due to unexpected errors, enhancing stability.

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your API keys:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
DEEPAI_API_KEY=your_deepai_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` and `your_deepai_api_key_here` with your actual API keys.
